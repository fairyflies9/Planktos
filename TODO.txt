- Add immersed boundary interaction in 2D, then 3D
  - Add mesh loading. IB2d for 2D, stl for 3D using numpy-stl. Beware domain shifting.
  - Add plotting of stl meshes; see numpy-stl example
  - Run examples of the above from IB2d, 3D cylinder mesh data
- Start analysis library with some basic stuff. Include TDA.
- Code up rolling locust swarm, then add Brinkman flow and gusts
- LCS module?
- documentation (/doc)

--> Code release paper. Target: Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences
